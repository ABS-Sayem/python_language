### **Python Library or Package**
###### **Python Libaray or package is a collection of modules under a common namespace, created by placing different modules on a single directory along with some special file. This common namespace is created via a directory that contains all related modules.**
###### Note That:
* ###### **In order to make a Library/Package, a special file namely "*__init__.py*" must be stored in the same directory. The *__init__* file can be empty.**
* ###### **A library may have one or more packages or sub-packages**
